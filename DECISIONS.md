# Decisions

Record of non-obvious technical decisions, in chronological order. Each
entry: context, decision, rationale, alternatives considered.

## 2026-09-09 — Rendering abstraction: bgfx

**Context:** Need one rendering path across Windows/Linux/macOS/Android/iOS
without hand-writing five backends (D3D12, Vulkan, Metal, GL/GLES).

**Decision:** Use bgfx as the sole GPU abstraction. Game/engine code talks
to `engine/rendering`, never directly to a graphics API, except where an
undocumented exception is later added here.

**Alternatives considered:** raw Vulkan-everywhere (rejected: no Metal
support, big maintenance burden on Apple platforms), Diligent Engine
(viable alternative, heavier and less battle-tested for mobile), five
hand-rolled backends (rejected outright by the project brief — too much
surface to maintain correctly).

## 2026-09-09 — Windowing/input: SDL3

**Decision:** SDL3 owns window creation, keyboard/mouse/touch/gamepad
input, and platform bootstrapping on Windows/Linux/macOS/iOS/Android.
bgfx is initialized against the native window handle SDL3 provides
(`SDL_GetWindowSizeInPixels` + platform-specific handle via
`SDL_GetPointerProperty` / `SDL_PROP_WINDOW_*` properties in SDL3).

**Alternatives considered:** GLFW (no mobile support — rejected), writing
our own platform layer (rejected — SDL3 already solves this correctly and
is BSD-licensed, effectively zero cost to depend on).

## 2026-09-09 — Dependency fetch strategy: CMake FetchContent, pinned tags

**Decision:** All third-party dependencies are pulled via
`FetchContent_Declare(... GIT_TAG <pinned commit or release tag>)` from
`third_party/CMakeLists.txt`, never vendored as committed source, never
fetched by floating branch. Verified from this sandbox that outbound
`https://github.com/...` git clones succeed (`api.github.com` REST calls
are blocked by the network policy here, but `git` over https and
`raw.githubusercontent.com` are reachable).

**Rationale:** Reproducible builds, easy version bumps, avoids repo bloat.
Documented per section 66/12 of the project brief: version, license,
source and build method tracked in `third_party/README.md`.

## 2026-09-09 — bgfx CMake integration: bkaradzic/bgfx.cmake wrapper

**Context:** Upstream bgfx/bx/bimg build via GENie/premake, not native
CMake.

**Decision:** Use the community-maintained `bkaradzic/bgfx.cmake` wrapper,
which vendors CMake build rules for bx/bimg/bgfx and is the de facto
standard way to consume bgfx from a CMake superproject.

**Risk noted:** This is a third-party CMake wrapper, not upstream-official.
Pin to an exact commit and verify build output before relying on it in
CI/release builds; re-evaluate if the wrapper lags upstream bgfx
significantly.

## 2026-09-09 — Server has zero GPU/window dependency

**Decision:** `VoxelEngine` is built twice conceptually: the headless
subset used by `VoxelServer` excludes `engine/platform` (SDL3) and
`engine/rendering` (bgfx) entirely via CMake target composition — the
server links a `VoxelEngineCore` object library that never references
those directories, rather than linking `VoxelEngine` and hoping unused
symbols get stripped. This is enforced by the server target simply not
depending on those subdirectories' targets, not by preprocessor guards.

## 2026-09-09 — Own math library, no GLM dependency

**Decision:** `engine/math` implements the minimal set of vector/matrix
primitives needed (float3, float4, mat4, quaternion) rather than adding
GLM or another math dependency. The project brief's dependency list
(bgfx, SDL3, Lua, GoogleTest/Catch2, fmt/spdlog, compression, physics
"only if required") does not include a math library, and GLM is a single
well-scoped enough problem to own directly and keep dependency count down
per section 66.

## 2026-09-09 — Logging: fmt (not spdlog) for Phase 0

**Decision:** Start with `fmt` only for formatted logging output, add a
minimal `engine/core/log.h` wrapper. Defer pulling in spdlog until actual
need for async/file sinks, threaded logging appears (Phase 6+/7 once
server logging requirements are concrete). Wrapper API is designed so
swapping the backend later doesn't touch call sites.
