# Decisions

Record of non-obvious technical decisions, in chronological order. Each
entry: context, decision, rationale, alternatives considered.

## 2026-09-09 — Rendering abstraction: bgfx

**Context:** Need one rendering path across Windows/Linux/macOS/Android/iOS
without hand-writing five backends (D3D12, Vulkan, Metal, GL/GLES).

**Decision:** Use bgfx as the sole GPU abstraction. Game/engine code talks
to `engine/rendering`, never directly to a graphics API, except where an
undocumented exception is later added here.

**Alternatives considered:** raw Vulkan-everywhere (rejected: no Metal
support, big maintenance burden on Apple platforms), Diligent Engine
(viable alternative, heavier and less battle-tested for mobile), five
hand-rolled backends (rejected outright by the project brief — too much
surface to maintain correctly).

## 2026-09-09 — Windowing/input: SDL3

**Decision:** SDL3 owns window creation, keyboard/mouse/touch/gamepad
input, and platform bootstrapping on Windows/Linux/macOS/iOS/Android.
bgfx is initialized against the native window handle SDL3 provides
(`SDL_GetWindowSizeInPixels` + platform-specific handle via
`SDL_GetPointerProperty` / `SDL_PROP_WINDOW_*` properties in SDL3).

**Alternatives considered:** GLFW (no mobile support — rejected), writing
our own platform layer (rejected — SDL3 already solves this correctly and
is BSD-licensed, effectively zero cost to depend on).

## 2026-09-09 — Dependency fetch strategy: CMake FetchContent, pinned tags

**Decision:** All third-party dependencies are pulled via
`FetchContent_Declare(... GIT_TAG <pinned commit or release tag>)` from
`third_party/CMakeLists.txt`, never vendored as committed source, never
fetched by floating branch. Verified from this sandbox that outbound
`https://github.com/...` git clones succeed (`api.github.com` REST calls
are blocked by the network policy here, but `git` over https and
`raw.githubusercontent.com` are reachable).

**Rationale:** Reproducible builds, easy version bumps, avoids repo bloat.
Documented per section 66/12 of the project brief: version, license,
source and build method tracked in `third_party/README.md`.

## 2026-09-09 — bgfx CMake integration: bkaradzic/bgfx.cmake wrapper

**Context:** Upstream bgfx/bx/bimg build via GENie/premake, not native
CMake.

**Decision:** Use the community-maintained `bkaradzic/bgfx.cmake` wrapper,
which vendors CMake build rules for bx/bimg/bgfx and is the de facto
standard way to consume bgfx from a CMake superproject.

**Risk noted:** This is a third-party CMake wrapper, not upstream-official.
Pin to an exact commit and verify build output before relying on it in
CI/release builds; re-evaluate if the wrapper lags upstream bgfx
significantly.

## 2026-09-09 — Server has zero GPU/window dependency

**Decision:** `VoxelEngine` is built twice conceptually: the headless
subset used by `VoxelServer` excludes `engine/platform` (SDL3) and
`engine/rendering` (bgfx) entirely via CMake target composition — the
server links a `VoxelEngineCore` object library that never references
those directories, rather than linking `VoxelEngine` and hoping unused
symbols get stripped. This is enforced by the server target simply not
depending on those subdirectories' targets, not by preprocessor guards.

## 2026-09-09 — Own math library, no GLM dependency

**Decision:** `engine/math` implements the minimal set of vector/matrix
primitives needed (float3, float4, mat4, quaternion) rather than adding
GLM or another math dependency. The project brief's dependency list
(bgfx, SDL3, Lua, GoogleTest/Catch2, fmt/spdlog, compression, physics
"only if required") does not include a math library, and GLM is a single
well-scoped enough problem to own directly and keep dependency count down
per section 66.

## 2026-09-09 — bgfx.cmake build environment requirements (Linux sandbox)

**Context:** First attempt to configure `LCU_ENABLE_BGFX=ON` failed CMake's
`find_package(OpenGL)` check inside bgfx.cmake (missing dev headers), and
after that was fixed, the final `VoxelClient` link failed with
`cannot find -lwayland-egl`.

**Decision/action:** Installed `libgl1-mesa-dev`, `libglu1-mesa-dev`,
`mesa-common-dev` (provides OpenGL dev headers + `libGL.so` symlink for
`FindOpenGL`) and `libwayland-dev` (provides the `libwayland-egl.so`
unversioned symlink the linker needs; the runtime `.so.1` was already
present as a transitive dependency) via `apt-get` in this sandbox. These
are build-time/link-time only — bgfx still picks its actual runtime
backend (Vulkan/GL/Noop) at `bgfx::init` time, this doesn't force GL.

**Follow-up for other environments/CI:** any Linux build host building the
client with `LCU_ENABLE_BGFX=ON` needs the same OpenGL + Wayland dev
packages installed, even if the target renderer is Vulkan — bgfx's CMake
still probes for GL/Wayland as part of its multi-backend build. Document
this in a future `BUILDING.md` rather than assuming a bare toolchain image
suffices.

## 2026-09-09 — bgfx API surface at the pinned version (v1.159.9485-575)

**Context:** Wrote `engine/rendering/Renderer` against the bgfx API
documented in older tutorials/examples (`bgfx::Init::resolution`,
`bgfx::Init::platformData.nwh/ndt`, `bgfx::reset(width, height, flags)`).
The pinned bgfx tag has since refactored multi-window support: the native
window handle, display type, and swap-chain width/height now live under
`bgfx::Init::swapChain` (a `bgfx::SwapChain`), not a flat
`resolution`/`platformData` pair; `bgfx::PlatformData` only carries
`context`/`queue`/`type` now; and `bgfx::reset()` takes `(flags,
swapChain*)`, not `(width, height, flags)`.

**Decision:** Adapted `Renderer::init`/`resize` to the current
`Init::swapChain` shape rather than pinning an older bgfx tag to match
outdated examples — the newer API is the one actually shipped at our
pinned commit and multi-window support is directly useful for Phase 1
tooling (debug windows, etc.) later. Recorded here so nobody "fixes" this
back to the older shape while copying an outdated bgfx example.

**Verification:** `VoxelClient` built with `LCU_ENABLE_BGFX=ON`, run under
`SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy` (no native window handle available -> `Renderer`
falls back to `bgfx::RendererType::Noop` automatically) completes 5 frames
of `bgfx::init` -> `setViewClear`/`setViewRect`/`touch`/`frame` ->
`bgfx::shutdown` cleanly. Real GPU backend (Vulkan/GL) selection and an
actual on-screen frame are **not** verified — no display/GPU in this
sandbox; needs confirmation on a machine with one.

## 2026-09-09 — BlockRegistry lives in engine/voxel, not engine/modding

**Context:** The brief's directory layout (section 7) puts "registries"
conceptually near modding, but `BlockRegistry` is needed by
`engine/voxel` itself (chunk storage stores `BlockId`s that only mean
anything relative to a registry) well before Phase 9's Lua/mod-loading
work exists.

**Decision:** `BlockRegistry` and `BlockDefinition` live in
`engine/voxel` now. `engine/modding` (Phase 9) will add mod-facing
registration (Lua bindings, `mod.json` parsing, hot reload) on top of
this same registry rather than owning a separate one - the registry
itself doesn't need to move, only gain a scripting-facing API layer.
Revisit only if that layering turns out to be awkward once Phase 9
starts.

## 2026-09-09 — Chunk storage: flat array now, no palette compression yet

**Context:** Minecraft-style engines often use per-chunk palette
compression (small run-length/indexed encoding) to cut memory for
mostly-uniform chunks (e.g. all-stone underground).

**Decision:** `ChunkStorage<EdgeLength>` starts as a flat, contiguous
`std::array<BlockId, Volume>` - simplest correct thing, already
cache-friendly and allocation-free. Deferred: palette compression. Brief
section 76 requires baseline -> profile -> optimize, in that order;
there is no baseline yet to know whether this matters, and adding
compression now would be optimizing before measuring (brief section 98).
Revisit once Phase 3 world streaming gives real chunk-memory numbers to
profile.

## 2026-09-09 — Block state (rotation/orientation/etc.) not encoded yet

**Context:** Brief section 17 wants compact block state (rotation,
powered, open, age, variant, waterlogged) alongside the block type.

**Decision:** `Chunk` currently stores only `BlockId` per cell, no
packed state bits. No block in the registry yet needs state (there are
no blocks registered at all outside unit tests) - adding a state-packing
scheme now would be speculative. When the first stateful block is
needed (a directional block, a candidate for the Phase 9 example mod),
extend the per-cell storage then, informed by what that block actually
needs to encode.

## 2026-09-09 — Job system: single mutex+condvar, correctness first

**Context:** Brief section 19 asks for a job system with priority,
dependencies, cancellation, worker threads - needed (section 18) before
chunk meshing can run off the main thread. Job systems are a classic
place to over-engineer prematurely (lock-free queues, work-stealing
per-thread deques, etc.).

**Decision:** `engine/jobs::JobSystem` uses one `std::mutex` +
`std::condition_variable` guarding all scheduling bookkeeping (the
job/dependency graph, the ready queue). Job *bodies* run unlocked - only
scheduling decisions are serialized, not the work itself. This is not
the fastest possible design (a lock-free MPMC queue or per-worker
work-stealing deques would scale better under heavy contention), but it
is straightforward to reason about and verify correct, which matters
more when nothing depends on its throughput yet (brief section 76:
baseline -> profile -> optimize, in that order; section 98: no
overengineering). Revisit only once Phase 11 profiling on real workloads
(chunk generation/meshing at actual world-streaming volumes) shows
scheduling contention is an actual bottleneck.

**Cancellation semantics:** `cancel()` only prevents jobs that haven't
started (`Pending`/`Ready`) from running, and cascades to their
dependents (a job whose dependency is cancelled can never satisfy its
precondition, so it's cancelled too). It cannot preempt a `Running` job -
no consumer has needed that yet, and cooperative-preemption support
(checking a cancellation flag inside long-running job bodies) is easy to
add later for whichever job type first needs it (likely worldgen/chunk
generation when a player moves away before generation finishes).

**Verification approach:** unit tests alone are not strong evidence for
concurrent code (a data race can pass every run and still be UB). Ran
the job-system test suite 200x in the normal build and 50x under GCC
ThreadSanitizer (`-fsanitize=thread`, Clang's TSan runtime wasn't
installed in this sandbox) - zero failures, zero race reports either
way. See `BUILDING.md` "Testing under ThreadSanitizer" for the exact
commands; re-run this whenever `engine/jobs` changes.

## 2026-09-09 — Logging: fmt (not spdlog) for Phase 0

**Decision:** Start with `fmt` only for formatted logging output, add a
minimal `engine/core/log.h` wrapper. Defer pulling in spdlog until actual
need for async/file sinks, threaded logging appears (Phase 6+/7 once
server logging requirements are concrete). Wrapper API is designed so
swapping the backend later doesn't touch call sites.
