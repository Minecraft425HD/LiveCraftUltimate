# Project State

Read this file first in every new session, then `TASK_QUEUE.md`,
`ROADMAP.md`, `BUILD_STATUS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, and
`NETWORKING.md` once networking is relevant, in that order, before
touching code. The repository is the source of truth, not this file's
prose if the two disagree — if in doubt, run the build and tests and
trust what actually happens (see `BUILD_STATUS.md` for the exact
commands).

## Current Phase

Phase 0 through 7 complete/functionally complete for what this headless
sandbox can verify. Phase 8 (replication + prediction + interpolation)
is also functionally complete: `engine/replication`'s prediction buffer
and position interpolator, the shared `game::systems::protocol` wire
messages, and a real, verified `VoxelClient`<->`VoxelServer` multiplayer
connection are done and tested.

## Current Task

None in flight. Next up per `TASK_QUEUE.md`: **Phase 9 — Modding +
registries + Lua + events.** A Lua dependency, genuinely mod-extensible
registries, an event system, a mod loader, and `example_mod`.

## Last Completed Task

Phase 8: added `engine/replication::PositionInterpolator` (buffers
timestamped position samples, linearly interpolates at a small render
delay behind the latest arrival, clamps rather than extrapolates past
it) and `engine/replication::PredictionBuffer<State, Input>` (generic
client-side prediction + server reconciliation: applies an input
immediately and records it, then on a later authoritative correction
discards acknowledged history and replays what's left on top of it).
Both fully unit-tested, the latter against both a hand-verifiable plain
value instantiation and a real `PlayerPhysicsState`/`integrate_player`
instantiation with hand-computed expected results.

Added `game::systems::protocol` - the shared wire-message definitions
(`Welcome`, `Heartbeat`, `EntityState`, `PlayerInput`, `PlayerCorrection`)
`VoxelClient` and `VoxelServer` both use, so the two executables can't
independently drift out of sync. `VoxelServer` now tracks one real
`PlayerPhysicsState` per connected client, driven by received
`PlayerInput` messages through the same physics `VoxelClient` runs, and
periodically reports it back via `PlayerCorrection`; its `EntityState`
broadcast is filtered per-client by a real interest-management distance
check. `VoxelClient` gained a `LCU_CONNECT_PORT`-gated networked mode
(loopback IPv4 only for now, single-player behavior completely
unchanged when unset): predicts local player movement immediately and
reconciles against the server's corrections, and renders server-driven
AI entities through client-side interpolation instead of simulating
them locally.

Verified via a real two-process run: a `VoxelClient` process connected
to a running `VoxelServer` process over real loopback UDP, received a
genuine Welcome (`world_seed=1337 tick_rate=20`), rendered all 3 remote
AI entities' positions through real interpolation, and had its player
position predicted, sent, and reconciled against the server's
authoritative correction - the entire prediction -> network ->
correction -> reconciliation loop actually exercised end to end.
Single-player mode reverified byte-for-byte unchanged in both build
configs. Chunk network streaming and block-edit replication are
explicitly deferred - see NETWORKING.md.

26 new unit tests (`PositionInterpolator`, `PredictionBuffer`,
`ReplicationProtocol`), plus the real two-process multiplayer run above
(not an automated `ctest` case - see BUILD_STATUS.md for the reproduce
steps). `ctest` 247/247 passing (bgfx build) / 244/244 (non-bgfx build).

## Build Status

See `BUILD_STATUS.md` for the full target-by-target table. Summary: core
engine + platform + rendering(bgfx) + client + server + tests all
**TESTED** in this Linux sandbox, headlessly (no display/GPU here — a
real Vulkan/GL backend actually presenting to a screen is **not**
verified; someone with a desktop needs to confirm that). Windows/macOS/
Android/iOS builds are **BLOCKED here** for lack of the relevant
toolchain/host, not because the CMake presets are known-broken.

## Test Status

`ctest --test-dir build/dev-bgfx`: 247/247 passing (this build dir is
configured with `LCU_BUILD_SHADER_TOOLS=ON` too, so it also produces
compiled chunk shaders - `ctest` itself doesn't test shader compilation
directly, that's verified by actually running `VoxelClient`, see
`BUILD_STATUS.md`). `ctest --test-dir build/dev-nobgfx`: 244/244 passing
(`ChunkMeshUpload.*` only exists in the bgfx build, since it needs a
real bgfx context). Covers Log, Vec3, Mat4, FrameStats, InputState,

additionally verified via 200 repeated `ctest`-suite runs and 50 runs
under ThreadSanitizer, zero failures/races - see `BUILDING.md` "Testing
under ThreadSanitizer" for the exact commands. GreedyMesher's triangle
winding is verified via a geometric cross-product check, not just
vertex counts. Real integration tests exist for networking
(`LoopbackIntegration.*`: two `Connection`s over real loopback UDP
sockets, one deliberately dropping the first real datagram sent) and,
outside the automated suite, a real two-process `VoxelClient`<->
`VoxelServer` multiplayer run (see BUILD_STATUS.md); save/load is still
unit-tested only, not yet exercised through a full server-save/
client-load cycle since there's no server-side world-save trigger yet,
and `VoxelClient`/`VoxelServer` don't call it either - see Known
Limitations.

## Known Bugs

None currently tracked.

## Known Limitations

- `VoxelClient` loads a static, fixed 36-chunk area around spawn once at
  startup (a 3x3 column of chunks, 4 chunks tall) rather than calling
  `World::update_streaming` every frame from the player's actual
  position - the player can walk outside the loaded area (movement/
  physics/raycast simply stop finding chunks there; `chunk_at`/
  `chunk_at_mutable` return null and break/place silently no-ops, logged
  at debug level). Wiring `update_streaming` into the per-frame loop is
  deferred, not forgotten - see DECISIONS.md.
- `World::update_streaming` itself still streams a 3D cube by Chebyshev
  distance, not the horizontal-disc-plus-bounded-vertical shape real
  worlds want. A camera/player now exists (Phase 4) but `VoxelClient`
  doesn't call `update_streaming` yet (see above), so there's still no
  real caller to validate a disc-shaped version against.
- Worldgen only implements continental+terrain (brief section 21's first
  two pipeline stages) - no climate/biome/caves/ores/structures/
  vegetation/decoration, and no surface/subsurface block variation
  (dirt/grass over stone) - single block type fills everything below
  the height.
- Chunk save/load (`engine/serialization::chunk_serializer`) is
  unit-tested in isolation but still not wired to any actual trigger in
  `VoxelClient` or `VoxelServer` (no "save world" command, no server
  persistence loop yet - Phase 7+). Brief section 80's slice 1 is closed
  in the sense that the save/load primitive exists and break/place
  mutates real in-memory chunk data; persisting those edits to disk from
  a live client/server session is still open.
- Look input is arrow keys, not mouse-look - SDL relative-mouse-mode
  plumbing doesn't exist yet (see `engine/platform/include/lcu/platform/
  input.h` and DECISIONS.md). A real, usable interim control scheme, not
  a placeholder that does nothing.
- Block-break's item drop is a direct, hardcoded 1:1 mapping
  (`stone block -> stone item`) written into `VoxelClient` itself, not a
  general loot-table/drop-rate system - there's only one droppable block
  type to motivate one, so a real table is deferred until more than one
  exists (see DECISIONS.md).
- `Inventory` has no UI - no hotbar rendering, no drag-drop, no way for
  a player to see or rearrange their items (needs `engine/ui`, a later
  phase). `player_inventory` in `VoxelClient` is currently only
  observable via log lines.
- `RecipeRegistry` has no crafting-grid caller anywhere - implemented
  and unit-tested standalone, same as `BlockRegistry`/`ItemRegistry`
  were before `VoxelClient` used them. No crafting table/UI exists yet
  to feed it a real grid.
- Only one block type (`game:stone`) exists anywhere outside unit tests;
  placing a block always places stone.
- Lighting (`engine/lighting`) is single-chunk scoped - no light bleeds
  across a chunk boundary yet (a bright torch one block from a chunk
  edge won't light the neighboring chunk's cells, and sky light doesn't
  know whether the chunk above it is open sky or a solid roof). Sky
  light also doesn't spread laterally under overhangs (straight
  top-down column fill only). See DECISIONS.md.
- Computed light (`engine/lighting::Light`, held per-chunk in
  `VoxelClient`'s `chunk_light`) isn't consumed by anything visual yet -
  the chunk shader is still flat directional+ambient lit with no
  per-voxel light sampling. Only observed via a log line
  ("Sky light 5 blocks above spawn column: ...").
- `DayNightCycle` ticks and its `sky_light_scale()` is correct and
  tested, but nothing scales the actual rendered scene or
  `engine/lighting` data by it yet - also log-line-only for now.
- AI (`game::systems::update_ai_wander`) is wander-only: no player
  awareness, no pathfinding/obstacle avoidance (a wandering entity can
  walk into a wall and just stops making progress until its next
  target pick), no combat/interaction. The 3 spawned entities in
  `VoxelClient` have no visual representation (no mesh/model system for
  entities yet) - only logged positions.
- `VoxelClient`'s networked mode (`LCU_CONNECT_PORT`) only connects to
  `127.0.0.1` - there is no hostname/IP-string parser anywhere yet, and
  no in-game "connect to a server" UI. A real "join by address" flow is
  later work.
- Chunk data and block edits aren't replicated over the network at all.
  Both a connected client and the server generate their own independent
  copy of the world from the same hardcoded seed; break/place still only
  mutates the client's own local `World`, invisible to the server or any
  other client. Chunk streaming specifically needs message
  fragmentation `engine/network::Connection` doesn't implement yet (a
  compressed chunk doesn't fit in one UDP datagram) - see NETWORKING.md.
- `VoxelClient`'s networked mode logs the `Welcome` message's
  `world_seed` but doesn't actually use it for world generation - it
  still calls its own compile-time `kWorldSeed`, which by construction
  runs before any network round-trip could complete. Both are hardcoded
  to 1337 today so this isn't currently observable as a mismatch - see
  NETWORKING.md.
- `engine/network::Connection`'s reliable channels have no RTT
  estimation, congestion control, or max-resend cutoff - a fixed
  retransmit interval, forever. Correct (tested, including under real
  simulated loss) but not tuned for real-world network conditions - see
  NETWORKING.md/DECISIONS.md.
- `VoxelServer`'s connection model has no authentication - any UDP
  datagram from a new address is treated as a new client connection, no
  questions asked. A `PlayerInput`'s reported `dt` is trusted (clamped to
  a ceiling, but not otherwise validated) - a real anti-cheat concern for
  any public deployment, fine for this vertical slice. See NETWORKING.md.
- `Connection`'s reorder buffer and duplicate-detection set for the two
  reliable channels use raw `u16` sequence values in
  ordered/hash containers, whose numeric ordering doesn't account for
  wraparound the way `sequence_greater_than` does - only matters past
  65536 messages on a single channel of one connection, far beyond this
  vertical slice's traffic volume. See NETWORKING.md.
- Interest management (`VoxelServer`'s per-client `EntityState`
  distance filter) is real logic but never actually exercised excluding
  an entity in any verification run so far - this vertical slice's
  world and AI wander radius are small enough that everything stays
  within `kInterestRadius` of any client near spawn. See NETWORKING.md.
- Every multiplayer verification run so far has used exactly one
  connected client - multiple simultaneous clients are structurally
  supported (`VoxelServer` already keys everything by `Address` in a
  map) but untested together.
- bgfx's real GPU backend (Vulkan/GL/Metal/D3D) selection is untested —
  only the `Noop` headless fallback has been exercised, since this sandbox
  has no GPU/display.
- Mobile/Windows/macOS builds are untested from this Linux-only sandbox;
  `CMakePresets.json` presets exist for them but have not been exercised
  on their native toolchains.
- Input abstraction covers keyboard only (`KeyboardInputBackend`); no
  real mouse-look, gamepad or touch backend yet — camera look is driven
  by arrow keys (`LookUp/Down/Left/Right`, see `DECISIONS.md`) as an
  interim scheme until SDL relative-mouse-mode is wired up; gamepad/touch
  still have no consumer until mobile work starts (Phase 10).
- Debug overlay is a log line, not an on-screen overlay — needs
  `engine/ui`/text rendering (later phase) to actually draw on screen.
- No block state encoding yet (rotation/orientation/powered/etc., brief
  section 17) — deferred until a block actually needs it (see
  `DECISIONS.md`).
- No palette/run-length compression on chunk storage — flat array only,
  deferred until Phase 3 world streaming gives real memory numbers to
  profile (brief section 76).
- `JobSystem` scheduling is a single mutex + condition variable, not
  lock-free or work-stealing — correctness-first, unoptimized (see
  DECISIONS.md). Fine at today's job volumes (its own tests); revisit
  only if Phase 11 profiling shows contention actually matters once real
  workloads (chunk gen/meshing) exist.
- `JobSystem::cancel()` only prevents not-yet-started jobs from running;
  it cannot preempt a job already `Running`. No use case has needed
  preemption yet.
- Greedy meshing produces only the opaque layer; transparent/water
  layers exist structurally but are always empty (no transparent block
  registered anywhere, and transparent-vs-transparent face rules are
  deliberately unimplemented until one exists — see DECISIONS.md).
- No texture atlas/UV mapping validation — `MeshVertex.u`/`.v` are
  populated (quad-local, in block units) but nothing downstream
  consumes or checks them yet, since there's no atlas (Phase 12).
- Shader compilation (`LCU_BUILD_SHADER_TOOLS`) is opt-in and OFF by
  default — most builds/CI runs won't have a real draw call unless this
  is explicitly turned on, since it adds real build time (shaderc +
  glslang/SPIRV-Tools/SPIRV-Cross/Dawn-Tint).
- Chunk shaders have no texturing — flat lit color only. `MeshVertex.u`/
  `.v` are populated but unused downstream until a texture atlas exists
  (Phase 12).
- No visual verification of any rendering exists or can exist in this
  sandbox — every claim above about the draw call is about the API
  calls succeeding (valid handles, no crash, bgfx accepts the shader
  binaries), not about correct-looking output on a screen.

## Next Task

1. Phase 9: add a Lua dependency (decide the exact library - e.g. Lua
   5.4 itself vs. LuaJIT vs. sol2/LuaBridge as a binding layer - and
   record the choice and rationale in DECISIONS.md when this starts).
2. Expand registries (`BlockRegistry`/`ItemRegistry` already exist and
   are namespaced/datadriven; add `EntityRegistry`/`BiomeRegistry`/
   `RecipeRegistry` is already done/`StructureRegistry`/`SoundRegistry`/
   `CommandRegistry`) to be genuinely mod-extensible - callable from Lua,
   not just C++ call sites.
3. Event system: something a mod can subscribe to (block broken, entity
   spawned, player joined, ...) without the engine knowing mods exist.
4. Mod loader: discover/load mod manifests and their Lua scripts at
   startup.
5. `example_mod` (brief section 91) exercising the above - a real,
   working mod, not just the loader infrastructure with nothing loaded
   into it.
6. Update state docs and commit after each step, same as every prior
   one.

## Current Architecture

See `ARCHITECTURE.md`. Layering is GAME -> VOXEL ENGINE ->
RENDERING ABSTRACTION -> BGFX -> platform backend. Server links only the
headless `Lcu::EngineCore` + `Lcu::Game`, never `Lcu::Engine`/
`Lcu::Platform` (SDL) or bgfx — enforced by the CMake target graph,
verified via `ldd`. `engine/rendering::Renderer` is the only place besides
`engine/platform` allowed to include bgfx/SDL headers.

## Important Decisions

See `DECISIONS.md` for full rationale. Headlines: bgfx for rendering, SDL3
for windowing/input, CMake FetchContent pinned to exact tags for all
dependencies, own minimal math library instead of GLM, server built as a
genuinely separate target with no GPU/window dependency, `BlockRegistry`
living in `engine/voxel` (not `engine/modding`) since chunk storage needs
it well before Phase 9's mod-loading exists, chunk storage as a flat
array with no palette compression or block-state packing until something
concrete needs either.
